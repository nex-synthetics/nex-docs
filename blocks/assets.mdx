NEX comes built with Asset storage. In this section, we will go over how to upload your own assets and begin your controllable image generation journey.

<Tip>
Upload **images** that are as **high res** as possible and have the least amount of blurriness.
</Tip>

#### 1. In the Artboard, click on “Assets” in the left action bar 

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/assets/1.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

#### 2. Click on “Choose File” to open up a window for your asset selection.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/assets/2.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

#### 3. After selecting the image that you want to upload, click on “Open” or press “Enter” on your keyboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/assets/3.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

#### 4. You will then be presented with the asset upload modal. Here, you can complete the upload by clicking “Upload Image”. If you’ve changed your mind, click on “Discard All”.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/assets/4.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

#### 5. After successfully uploading your image, you can view it under the Assets Search Bar.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/assets/5.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

#### 6. Now, you can begin using your asset as a control. If you hover over your asset and and click “Use As”, you’ll be able to see the control options for  your asset. 

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/assets/6.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />

#### 7. Lastly, select the control that you want your asset to be, and it will be added to your Blocks Preview as well as denoted above the Upload Images section.
