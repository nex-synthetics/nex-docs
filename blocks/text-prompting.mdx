Type in what you want to generate, but try to avoid the following mistakes: 

<Tip>
Upload **images** that are as **high res** as possible and have the least amount of blurriness.
</Tip>

We know that it is tempting to treat NEX conversationally, but try to avoid words like these at the beginning of your prompts : imagine, create, draw, envision, construct, visualize, paint, and others like this.

For Example:

#### A good prompt for NEX would be: 

1. a richly textured mulberry paper with natural imperfections, ideal for exotic and unique Pi Day designs, paper texture, background

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/text/1.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

#### A bad prompt for NEX would be:

1. “imagine a richly textured mulberry paper with natural imperfections, ideal for exotic and unique Pi Day designs, paper, texture, background”

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/text/2.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

# Raw Mode

Click on the “Raw Mode” button in the the Number of Generations control to increase prompt coherence.  
You’ll know its on when the button is green.

<Tip>
How does this work? The raw caption is directly submitted to the model. At times, this may increase image quality 
</Tip>


<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/text/3.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

Raw Mode Comparison  
Prompt: a beautiful landscape shot of a robot standing in the middle of an open grass field, photorealistic, 4k

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/text/4.png" />
</Frame>

Note:  
The output follows the prompt much more closely when Raw Mode is turned On. When Raw Mode is turned Off, additional details appear such as: the lighting of the image, presence of the sun, and more prominent clouds.
