Type in what you want to generate, but try to avoid the following mistakes: 

<Tip>
Upload **images** that are as **high res** as possible and have the least amount of blurriness.
</Tip>

We know that it is tempting to treat NEX conversationally, but try to avoid words like these at the beginning of your prompts : imagine, create, draw, envision, construct, visualize, paint, and others like this.

For Example:

#### A good prompt for NEX would be: 

1. a richly textured mulberry paper with natural imperfections, ideal for exotic and unique Pi Day designs, paper texture, background

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/text/1.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

#### A bad prompt for NEX would be:

1. “imagine a richly textured mulberry paper with natural imperfections, ideal for exotic and unique Pi Day designs, paper, texture, background”

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/text/2.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

# Raw Mode

To maximize the prompt coherence from NEX, make sure you have Raw Mode set to On. You’ll know its on when the button is green.

<Tip>
This works by submitting the raw caption directly to the model. You may find that this increases image quality

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/blocks/text/3.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>
